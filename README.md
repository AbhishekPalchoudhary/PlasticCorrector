As an example, the following boundary value problem is considered:

The von Mises stress coming from an elastic computation (denoted by $\#$), scaled by a dimensionless proportional loading function $f(t)$.
Note: A prescribed displacement $\bar{\underbar{u}}_{a}^{\#}$ is applied such that $\bar{\sigma}_{\textrm{VM}}^{\#} = 100$ MPa in the gauge section away from pores.
$f(t)$ oscillates between +0.8 and -0.8, which leads to $f(t)\bar{\sigma}_{\textrm{VM}}^{\#} = 80$ MPa in the gauge section.
